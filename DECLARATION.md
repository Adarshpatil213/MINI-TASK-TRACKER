🧾 DECLARATION

I, Adarsh Patil, hereby declare that the "Task Tracker with Smart Insights" project submitted as part of the  
Full-Stack Developer (Python + JavaScript + DB + AI Awareness) — 24-Hour Assessment 
is entirely my own original work.

I have not used any AI tools, code generation assistants, or automated coding platforms  
such as ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, or similar technologies while completing this assignment.

All coding, logic design, and implementation — including backend APIs, database schema, and frontend integration —  
were written and tested by me within the given 24-hour time frame.

I fully understand that using external code generation tools without disclosure would lead to disqualification
from this assessment.
